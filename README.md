# Project Details:
This project is about learning machine learning 
# There are two types of machine learning
1. Supervised Learning
2. unsupervised Learning
# Supervised Learning
In supervised learning we have input and output data and we have to train our model on the basis of input and output data
# Unsupervised Learning
In unsupervised learning we have only input data and we have to train our model on the basis of input data
# There are two types of supervised learning
1. Regression
2. classification
# Regression
In regression we have to predict the continous values
# Classification
In classification we have to predict the discrete values
